# insta_delete
Selenium, BS4 powered script to delete old instagram posts.

Working with selenium can be challenging if you have no previous experience with it. Part of this project

## Prerequisites

Since I was already using chromedriver, I decided to use it for this project. I am not sure how different, if any, the selenium code would change if you decided to use the firefox driver. 


## Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt
